## Copilot Instructions
- **Project scope**: Maintain highly compatible static HTML outreach emails (`optimized-email-template-manu.html` is the live reference) plus shared assets in `Repository-direction-vscode/email-assets/`. No frameworks or build tooling are involved.
- **Layout conventions**: Tables (`table role="presentation"`) drive all structure. Keep the 640 px outer wrapper with nested spacer `<div style="height:...">` rows; avoid margin-based spacing to preserve Outlook fidelity.
- **Section scaffold**: Inline HTML comments label the reusable content blocks (Greeting, Highlights, Questions); keep that ordering so you can paste plain text and style it quickly.
- **Email boilerplate**: Preserve the hidden preheader block and the `<u>` dark-mode hack immediately after `<body>`, and never drop `<base target="_blank">` since it normalises outbound links.
- **Theming system**: Light/dark palettes live in the `<style>` block via the `.dm-page`, `.dm-outer`, `.contact-panel`, `.umwelt-panel`, and text utility classes. Colour tweaks must be mirrored across standard styles, the `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` rules, and the client overrides `[data-ogsc]`, `u + .body-root`, Proton-specific root selectors.
- **Image swapping**: Maintain paired `.light-mode-image` / `.dark-mode-image` wrappers even when both point to the same asset; this enables simple dark-mode swaps later without restructuring.
- **Responsive rules**: Mobile adjustments live in `@media screen and (max-width:480px)` and rely on `!important` overrides. Extend that block instead of introducing new breakpoints so styles survive client CSS resets.
- **Utility classes**: Use `.body-emphasis` for highlighted copy and `.body-underline` for consistent underlines; theme colours for these live in every light/dark override block.
- **Bullet pattern**: Follow the two-cell table layout (`.bullet-circle` + `.bullet-body`) for lists; spacing is tuned via padding, so replicate the exact structure when adding or reordering items.
- **Typography**: Fonts are defined inline per block (Roboto/Arial fallbacks). When introducing new text styles, copy the existing `font:` shorthand to stay consistent and avoid shorthand stripping.
- **Fixed footer**: Anything from the handwritten signature downward—including `.roles`, the contact panel, and the Umwelt notice—must stay structurally identical; adjust styling only through the shared CSS.
- **Assets workflow**: Host imagery at `https://ilghar.github.io/email-assets/...` with explicit `width`, `height`, and `display:block`. New assets must be added under `Repository-direction-vscode/email-assets/` and published via GitHub Pages before updating template URLs.
- **Verification**: There is no automated build/test. Preview HTML directly in a browser, send test emails through Gmail/Outlook, and toggle OS dark mode (or DevTools emulation) to confirm theme parity. Optional visual regression is prepped via `backstop.config.cjs`; run `npx backstop test --config=backstop.config.cjs` against a locally served page if you wire it up.
- **Responsive safeguards**: `.roles`, `.cv-button`, `.umwelt-p1`, and `.umwelt-p2` scale through the top-of-file mobile queries; keep any tweaks mirrored in dark-mode, OGSC, and Proton overrides to avoid regressions.
- **Editing discipline**: Stick to ASCII, keep inline styles intact, retain spacer rows even if they look redundant, and avoid reintroducing inline colours when a class already controls them. Add comments only for non-obvious hacks.
