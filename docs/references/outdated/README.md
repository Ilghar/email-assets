# Outdated / Legacy References

This folder lists legacy or archived resources that are historically useful but not recommended as primary references when coding today.

- Word 2007 HTML/CSS in Outlook (archived)
- IE conditional comments (archived)
- MSO Style Attributes (unofficial)

Keep these for context; prefer up-to-date specs, MDN, and caniemail.com/features for current guidance.
